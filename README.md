# GameOfLifePlus

A program that creates logic gates using Conway's Game of Life. Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton where a grid of alive and dead cells are governed by
3 simple rules:

1) Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude
2) Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation
3) Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated

Using these rules, the NOT, AND, and OR gates can be created. Patterns used include gliders, eaters, and stoppers.
